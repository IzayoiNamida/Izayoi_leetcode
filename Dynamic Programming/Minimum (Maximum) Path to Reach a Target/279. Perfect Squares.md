### Description

Here is a kanpsack with content **n**. You need to fullfill it with minimum value. Each item has **i*i** value and **1** cost.

### Solution

Basically, this is a **unbounded knapsack problem**. However, unlike the normal version, this time we need to choose items as least as possible. In this case, we need to use **Math.min()** rather than **Math.max()**. Also, in the initialization, we need to initial all dp[1...n] with MAX_VALUE, and dp[0] with 0.

The MAX_VALUE means that the knapsack has not been fullfilled. 

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSquares(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        int m = (int)Math.sqrt(n);
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){ //here are m items. For each item, 
            for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j++){
                dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j-i * i] + 1, dp[j]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
