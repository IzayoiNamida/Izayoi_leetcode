### Solution

Well, this is actually a 0-1 knapsack problem. There are stations.length knapsacks, we need to find one knapsack which has the farest distance to go. In each knapsack, it is a 0-1 knapsack problem. The volume of knapsack is as same as the refuel times, and the value of knapsack is the distance can reach. So we only need to find the farest distance of each knapsack. However, one thing should be noticed is that if the farest distance can't reach the next fule station, this  and the following station should not be considered anymore.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, int[][] stations) {
        long[] dp = new long[stations.length+1];
        dp[0] = startFuel;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < stations.length; i++){
            for(int j = i; j >= 0 && dp[j] >= stations[i][0]; j--){
                dp[j+1] = Math.max(dp[j+1], dp[j] + stations[i][1]);
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i <= stations.length; i++){
            if(dp[i] >= target)return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
